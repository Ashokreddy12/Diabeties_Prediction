# Predict diabetes using Machine Learning

## Diabetes
Diabetes is one of the critical disese where most of the people are affected due to higher glucose levels in their blood. 
Secondary life style, obesity, lack of exercise, hereditary, poor diet, high blood pressure, etc. can cause Diabetes. 
People having diabetes have high risk of diseases like heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, eye problem, nerve damage, etc.

## Goal
Multiple medical tests are available in the healthcare industry to predict the diabetes. 
*Can we predict a persion diabetic or not with the medical data?* **Yes!** we can predict using the latest machine learning algorithims. 

## Overview:
- As this is a classification (*diabetic or not diabetic*) problem, this project is developed using the ***KNN algorithm.*** 
For more deteails on KNN, please visit [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm "KNN Algorithm"). 
- An open source dataset is used for building the ML model.
- ML model is deployed in Google Cloud Platform. 

*Note: Though multiple classification algorithms are availble, KNN is picked for learning and end to end implementation purpose.*
